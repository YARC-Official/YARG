# 💸 Donate

Some people have expressed interest in donating. I just do this for fun and as a hobby, and as such, money is *not* something that you need to give me by any means. However, if you really want to, scroll up and under the "Sponsor this project" heading there is a link so you can donate. If you do such, I'd really appreciate, but again, it is not required.

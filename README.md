YARG (a.k.a. Yet Another Rhythm Game) is a free, open-source, plastic guitar game that is still in development. It supports guitar (five fret), drums (plastic or e-kit), vocals, pro-guitar, and more! YARG is still in active development, so there may be bugs and missing features.

## üì• Downloading and Playing

**It is recommended you download YARG via the [YARC Launcher](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARC-Launcher/releases/).** Downloading the portable option is not recommended as some features may not work.

### YARC Launcher (All Platforms)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are on Linux, there are some additional things you need to do in order for controllers to work. See the Linux section for more info.

1. Go to the YARC Launcher releases page, [here](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARC-Launcher/releases/).
2. Click on the download option for your operating system.
3. You may get a "this application is not safe" warning depending on your operating system. This is a false positive. [Click here](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARC-Launcher#-antivirus-warnings) to learn more.
4. Once in the launcher, click on "YARG" on the left hand side.
5. Then, click on green "Update Stable" button.
6. You will be prompted to choose an install folder. If you don't know what folder to choose, just click "Okay". Please ensure that the folder you select is empty.
7. Wait for it to finish installing...
8. Finally, press "Play Stable"!
9. Additionally, if you want some songs, install "YARG Setlist" which is also on the left in the YARC Launcher.

### Linux

There are some dependencies that will be needed in order for HID devices (such as PS3 and Wii instruments) to work.

1. Install `hidapi` and `libudev`:
   - (Package names may differ depending on package repositories.)
   - On apt-based distros (such as Ubuntu or Debian), use `sudo apt install libhidapi-hidraw0 libudev1`.
   - On pacman-based distros (such as Arch Linux), use `pacman -S hidapi systemd-libs`.
   - On Fedora, use `dnf install hidapi systemd-libs`.
2. Finally, create a new udev rules file called `69-hid.rules` inside of `/etc/udev/rules.d/` or `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`, with the following contents:
  ```
  KERNEL=="hidraw*", TAG+="uaccess"
  ```
  - Without this file, YARG will not be able to access HID devices without special permissions such as being run with `sudo`, which is not recommended.
  - The file name may differ if desired, but it must come before `73-seat-late.rules`!
3. Reboot your system to apply the new udev rule, then you should be all good to go!

## üî® Building/Contributing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### ‚ö†Ô∏è If you wish to contribute, use the `dev` branch. Your PR will NOT be merged if it's on `master`. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Setup Instructions

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you would like to build the game yourself, please follow these instructions.
>
> If you don't follow these instructions, it is possible that **YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN THE GAME**.

1. If you are planning to contribute, first make a fork of the project.
   - Be sure to *uncheck* the option to only include the `master` branch! You will not be able to set things up correctly otherwise, as the `dev` branch will not be included in your fork.

   ![](Images/Contributing/Include_All_Branches.png)

2. Make sure you have the latest version of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) installed. This is for loading models, even if you don't plan on editing them.
3. Clone the repository. If you are not familiar with git, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) plus the [GitLens extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) are both good GUI options. If, however, you want to use the command-line:
   1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Be sure it is added to system path.
   2. Also download [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com), and install it with the `git lfs install` command.
   3. Open the command prompt in the directory you want to store the repository.
   4. Clone the project repository:
   5. Type in `git clone -b dev --recursive <repository url>.git`, replacing `<repository url>` with either:
      - your fork's URL if you made one, or
      - the main repository's URL (`https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG`) if you just want to build the game.
      - A complete example using the main repository's URL is `git clone -b dev --recursive https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG.git`.
   6. Because YARG contains submodules, you may need to do `git submodule update` when things get updated.
4. Install Unity 2021.3.36f1. Easiest method will be using Unity Hub:
   1. Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).
   2. Sign-in/create an account with a personal license (free).
   3. In Unity Hub, hit the arrow next to Add and select `Add project from disk`, then select the folder you cloned YARG to.
   4. Click on the added entry for YARG. It will warn you about a missing editor version, select 2021.3.36f1 and install it.
      - Unselect Visual Studio in the list of modules if you wish to use another editor or already have it installed.
5. Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks). This is required to develop and build the submodules.
   - You will need the SDK specifically, not the runtime!
6. Open the project in Unity. When prompted about Safe Mode, click "Ignore".
   - Do *not* enter Safe Mode, otherwise scripts necessary to build/install dependencies will not run, and the errors will not resolve.

   ![](Images/Contributing/unityignore.png)

7. Ensure all dependencies have been built/restored:
  - Both of these steps should be performed automatically when Unity starts up, but they can be performend manually if needed.
  - Click on `YARG` on the top menu bar, then click on `Rebuild YARG.Core (Debug)`.
  - Click on `NuGet` on the top menu bar, then click on `Restore Packages`.
8. You're ready to go!

### Unity YAML Merge Tool

Sometimes merge conflicts may happen between Unity scenes. These can be much more difficult to resolve than other merge conflicts, so we recommend using the Unity YAML merge tool to resolve these instead of attempting to do so manually.

Setup:
1. Open a command prompt to the repository (on VS Code you can do Terminal > New Terminal)
2. Type in `git config --local --edit`
3. In the file that gets opened, go to the bottom and paste this in:
  ```
  [merge]
      tool = unityyamlmerge
  [mergetool "unityyamlmerge"]
      trustExitCode = false
      cmd = 'C:\\Program Files\\Unity\\Hub\\Editor\\2021.3.21f1\\Editor\\Data\\Tools\\UnityYAMLMerge.exe' merge -p "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"
  ```
  - You may need to change the file path depending on where you installed Unity to.
4. Save and close the file.

Resolving conflicts:
1. Start the merge/cherry-pick which is causing conflicts.
2. If the conflict doesn't resolve automatically, open the command prompt and use `git merge-tool`.
3. Verify that the conflict was resolved correctly, then commit/continue the merge.

 Software Layout:
    This controller is in the persistent scene. It is responsible for keeping track of the current state of the stage
    kits, sending commands to them, and tracking the cues. Each scene has its own loader (StagekitMenu, StagekitScore,
    StagekitGameplay), which is responsible for loading the lighting cues into the controller. Cues are made up of set
    of primitives that either follow the beat, triggered by an event, or timed. Some cues have multiple patterns.
    These patterns are not random, the same song in the same venue will have the same patterns for the cues each time.
    I do not know how that decided. Each venue is flagged as either Large or Small. This is used to determine which
    pattern sets will be uses for some cues. This is randomized currently, since there is no way to get venue size from
    the game, at the moment.

 Hardware layout:
    LED numbers on the pod:
    rockband logo
     7 0 1
      \|/
    6 -+-  2
      /|\
     5 4 3
    xbox button
    as well as the fog machine and strobe light. The fog machine has 2 settings, on and off. The strobe light has 5
    settings, off, slow, medium, fast, fastest. Only slow and fast are used in official songs. For details on how to
    send commands to the kit, see the IStageKitHaptics interface and Nate's fantastic work
    at https://github.com/TheNathannator/PlasticBand/blob/main/Docs/Other/Stage%20Kit/Xbox%20360.md

 Bugs and notes:
    During official light shows (For example, using the stage kit with RB2, on a xbox 360) the lights will sometimes
    behave in unexpected, song specific, one-off ways. It is hard to say if this is a bug or complex intended behavior.
    Since there are known bugs with the stage kit as is, I am going to assume these are also bugs since the programming
    required to make these bespoke song effects is not trivial and doesn't seem to make sense
    (such as random one led flashes). So stage shows will be slightly different than the official ones, but hopefully
    more consistent and predictable with what was intended. Sometimes just straight up better as entire cues are
    missing from the official shows.
    Sometimes pause doesn't work for fast strobe?? I legit don't know why this happens. It seems to be a
    bug with the stage kit itself.

  Not implemented because these things don't exist YARG:
    "About to fail song" light cues are not implemented since we don't support failing songs right now.
    Intro "walk on" lighting before the song starts (where it says "<user name> as <character name>") is not
    implemented because that doesn't exist.

 Implemented by YARG but not in the original game:
    Menu lighting


 The individual effects for the stage kit:

    NR = No visible response from Stage Kit
    VR = Response changes based on venue size
    RE = Response is the same regardless of venue size

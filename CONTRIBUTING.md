# Contributing to YARG
YARG actively wants new contributors! Whether you are an artist or a programmer, your addition to YARG matters. 
That being said, there are rules you have to follow which will be outlined in this document.
**If a rule is broken, your contribution may NOT be accepted.**

## Organization
To stay organized, please join our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r). This will allow people to talk about ideas, or get help. 
This is especially useful for artists, as they do not have to deal with GitHub if they are not familiar with it.

**Any** large, or larger issue that you are tackling **must** be documented in ["The List."](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XMSkLs-BX2Il0D41sgrrOOo1J9Lje_Anj-4XJt0AZOo/edit#gid=0)
If you want access to The List, you must join the Discord and DM me (EliteAsian123). The List **prevents two or more people from doing the same thing at once**. If something like that happens, it would be very sad and upsetting for all of the people involved.

## Basic Rules

1. All content/assets **MUST** be originally made, or be public domain. **NO RIPPING ASSETS FROM OTHER GAMES.** Your pull request will immediately be denied.
2. If you add source code from other libraries, or just add other libraries, **PLEASE CHECK IF THE LICENESES ARE COMPATIBLE**. If they are not, your pull request will also be denied.
3. Please try to keep commit names professional, and concise. Same with comments within the code.
4. Please try to follow code styling. I'll make a more detailed guide about this later.

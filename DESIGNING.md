# YARG Design Style
A game requires many pieces of a puzzle to fit together in order for it to feel, look, and to just be good. Because of this, a consistent philosophy and quality of work is required for it to fit together. This section contains information on its design guidelines, so contributors know how to approach adding new content to YARG.

# YARG Design Goals
* **Robustness and a ‚ÄúGood Default‚Äù:** The goal of YARG is for it to be as fun as possible for new players. Because of this, it is important that we provide users with a good default experience‚Äîmeaning, before changing the settings. All features of YARG should be as robust as possible, and not require external any \tinkering for it to work. It should just work.

* **Customization, and ‚ÄúModlessness‚Äù:** YARG‚Äôs end goal is for it to be as customizable as possible, so it suits the needs of all players, **without sacrificing competitive potential**. Modding of games usually happens because the game is missing a feature, or requires new content. YARG‚Äôs goal is for it to not require mods. All features that could be adjustable, should be. As for new content, the user should have the ability to do this without the need of external modification (i.e. new highways, etc.).

* **Familiarity, But Better:** YARG‚Äôs stylistic choices should reflect and be inspired off of the newest commercial 5-fret guitar games. The point of this is for it to be as familiar and ‚Äúat home‚Äù as possible for new players, while also delivering a new and polished experience. This means that inspiration is advised, but **innovation is recommended**.
